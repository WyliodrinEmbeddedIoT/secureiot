# Review

- Did you solve the homework?
- What were the issues?

# Hardware Interface Layer

Drivers comminicate with each other using HIL

Traits defined in the kernel (`kernel/src/hil/mod.rs`)

## The LED HIL

```rust
pub trait Led {
    /// Initialize the LED. Must be called before the LED is used.
    fn init(&self);

    /// Turn the LED on.
    fn on(&self);

    /// Turn the LED off.
    fn off(&self);

    /// Toggle the LED.
    fn toggle(&self);

    /// Return the on/off state of the LED. `true` if the LED is on, `false` if
    /// it is off.
    fn read(&self) -> bool;
}
```

---
## Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Add the Led HIL to the `LedMatrix` so that other drivers are abkle to control the LEDs.

1. Make a new struct in led_matrix.rs that receives:
  - a reference to the `LedMatrix`
  - an LED position
2. Implement the `Led` trait for this struct

---
# Grants

- Drivers may not allocate memeory themselves
- Drivers store data for every process
- Data is deallocated when the process stops

.card[.large[.center[![Borrow Rules](../images/sep_process_memory.png)]]]

---
## Grant Memory

.splash_vertical[.center[![Borrow Rules](../images/grant_memory.png)]]

---

## Grants Usage

In `hello.rs`
```rust
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct AppData {
    // ...
}

pub struct Hello {
    // ...
    grant: Grant<AppData>
}
```

In `main.rs`
```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe fn main() {
    // ...
    let grant_cap = create_capability!(capabilities::MemoryAllocationCapability);
    let grant_hello = board_kernel.create_grant(&grant_cap);

    let hello = static_init!(
        hello::Hello,
        hello::Hello::new(grant_hello)
    );
    // ...
}
```
---

## Using the Grant

```rust
impl Driver for Hello {
    fn command(
        &self,
        command_num: usize,
        _data1: usize,
        _data2: usize,
        process_id: ProcessId,
    ) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,
            1 => {
                self.grant.enter (process_id, |app| {
                    // process is of type AppData
                    // use process. ...
                    ReturnCode::SUCCESS
                }).unwrap_or_else (|err| err.into())
            }
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```

---

# Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Modify the counter driver to use a different counter for each process. Load two apps that print the counter at different intervals.

```rust
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// subscribe and allow will use the default implementation
    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _process_id: ProcessId) -> CommandReturn {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => CommandReturn::success(),
            1 => { debug! ("Print Hello"); CommandReturn::success() }
            2 => {
                // use a grant
                self.nr.set (self.nr.get () + 1);
                CommandReturn::success_u32 (value: self.nr.get());
            }
            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::failure (ErrorCode::NOSUPPORT),
        }
    }
}
```

# Sending Buffers

Apps may share data with drivers using the `allow` system calls and `ReadOnlyAppSlice` or `ReadWriteAppSlice` and `Gants`.

```rust
struct AppData {
    buffer: Option<ReadWriteAppSlice>
}

```rust
struct AppData {
    buffer: Option<ReadOnlyAppSlice>
}

struct Print {
    grant: Grant<AppData>
    // ...
}

impl Driver for Print {
    fn allow_readonly(&self, process: ProcessId, allow_num: usize, slice: ReadOnlyAppSlice) -> Result<ReadOnlyAppSlice, (ReadOnlyAppSlice, ErrorCode)> {
        match allow_num {
            0 => {
                let res = self
                .apps
                .enter(Processid, |app| {
                    mem::swap(&mut process.buffer, &mut slice);;
                    Ok(())
                }).map_err(ErrorCode::from);
                match res {
                    Err(e) => Err((slice, e)),
                    Ok(_) => Ok(slice),
                }
            }
            _ => Err((slice, ErrorCode::NOSUPPORT)),
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

---
### `enter` function

Checks if the process is still active:
  - runs the closure if yes
  - returns an error if not

Errors
```rust
pub fn enter<F, R>(&self, processid: ProcessId, fun: F) -> Result<R, Error>
    where
        F: FnOnce(&mut GrantMemory<T>) -> R {
            // ...    
        }

pub enum Error {
    NoSuchApp,
    OutOfMemory,
    AddressOutOfBounds,
    /// The process is inactive (likely in a fault or exit state) and the
    /// attempted operation is therefore invalid.
    InactiveApp,
    /// This likely indicates a bug in the kernel and that some state is
    /// inconsistent in the kernel.
    KernelError,
    /// Indicates some process data, such as a Grant, is already borrowed.
    AlreadyInUse,
}
```

---
## Reading Slices

The `Read` trait is implemented for `ReadOnlyAppSlice`
```rust
pub trait Read {
    /// Length of the memory region.
    fn len(&self) -> usize;

    /// Pointer to the first byte of the userspace memory region.
    fn ptr(&self) -> *const u8;

    /// Applies a function to the (read only) slice reference pointed
    /// to by the AppSlice.
    fn map_or<F, R>(&self, default: R, fun: F) -> R
    where
        F: FnOnce(&[u8]) -> R;
}
```
---
## Writing Slices

The `ReadWrite` trait is implemented for `ReadWriteAppSlice`
```rust
pub trait ReadWrite: Read {
    /// Applies a function to the mutable slice reference pointed to
    /// by the AppSlice.
    fn mut_map_or<F, R>(&mut self, default: R, fun: F) -> R
    where
        F: FnOnce(&mut [u8]) -> R;
}
```

---
### Example

Take a look at the Touch driver in `touch.rs`.

---
class: split-50
# System Call Pattern

.column[
1. Allow a buffer
2. Subscribe
3. Send a Command
4. Yield
5. Verify if your callback was called
  - yes, continue
  - no, yield again
]

.column[
.right[.card[.large_vertical[![System Call Pattern](../images/sep_syscall_pattern.png)]]]
]

---
# Homework .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

1. Write a driver that display digits or letters on the LED Matrix
2. Write a driver that display (scrolling) text on the LED Matrix
  - the process shares a read-only buffer with the driver
  - the process writes to the buffer and sends a command to the driver
  - the driver displays the text and notifies the process when it is done

Driver Parameters:
  - scrolling speed

# Project

Please prepare the following for Wednesday:

1. A full description of what your project does
2. The project acrhitecture:
    - what is un userspace (the apps)
    - what is in kernel space (the drivers)
3. How do the components interract with each other?
