# Review

- Did you solve the homework (3 and 4)?
- What were the issues?

---
# Advanced Topics

1. BLE Advertisment
2. Virtual Drivers

---
# BLE Advertisment

The BLE stack is incomplete
 - RuBLE is a work in progress

```rust
pub trait BleAdvertisementDriver<'a> {
    fn transmit_advertisement(&self, buf: &'static mut [u8], len: usize, channel: RadioChannel);
    fn receive_advertisement(&self, channel: RadioChannel);
    fn set_receive_client(&self, client: &'a dyn RxClient);
    fn set_transmit_client(&self, client: &'a dyn TxClient);
}
```

---
## Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Try the BLE example in `libtock-c`.

Examples in `examples/ble_advertising` and `examples/ble_passive_scanning`.

1. Send BLE advertisments and watch them show up on the phone
2. List all the BLE advertisments

---
## Simplified BLE data exchange

Use BLE advertisments to send data over BLE

1. Read some useful data (ex. sensors)
2. Encode the data into the device's BLE name (advertisment)
3. Send the advertisments for a few seconds
    - make sure you flag identical packets

---
## Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Send the acceleration value every 5 seconds using BLE advertisments

---
# Virtual Drivers

Each peripheral has one single client
 
This makes sharing peripherals:
  1. Betweeen drivers - impossible
  2. Between applications - possible
    - the Driver is the only one that can access that peripheral

---
## Sharing peripherals between drivers:

Example: temperature sensors

1. Exported to userspace using the `Temperature` driver
2. Used by the scheduler to know when to schedule less frequently 

---
## Virtual Devices

Multiplexers `Mux`

## Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Virtualize the temperature sensor
